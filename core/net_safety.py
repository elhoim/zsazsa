"""SSRF guard for outbound requests to a URL supplied in a user request.

Used by /api/fetch-url, which fetches a URL an analyst pastes in and returns
its content. Admin-configured integration targets (MISP, Flowintel, webhook
channels) are deliberately not checked: those are expected to be internal and
are reachable only to a site administrator.

resolve_public_url resolves the host once and returns the addresses it checked,
so the caller can pin the connection to them. Pinning closes the DNS-rebinding
window: without it, the host is validated here and then resolved a second time
by the HTTP client, and a name answering public now and internal a moment later
(TTL 0) would pass the check and still be fetched (CWE-367).
